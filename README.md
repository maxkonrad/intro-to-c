C (programming language) programmes I wrote when I was learning C Programming Language for the course EE103.

EE103, IZTECH ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING/Introduction to Programming Course

NOTE: I couldn't find lab-7 (encryption and decryption) and lab-8 (pointers) in my computer. I will upload them if I can find.

NOTE-2: You might need to change the main function's return type to int with respect to your local environment needs. (gcc or clang versions)
