# How I learned C Programming Language
* Fundamentals of this project lies to EE103 Class at IZTECH (Ä°zmir Institute of Technology) for Electronics and Comms. Engineering Program thaught by Cenk Efeler.
* I followed synchronus lectures at university in order to learn C basics and I wrote these codes to reinforce what I learned.
* But it is not mandatory to follow a lecture to learn C Programming Language, instead you can follow Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan's C book.
* There are also Open Source alternatives to this book, [Free Modern C Book](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654/file/ModernC.pdf)
